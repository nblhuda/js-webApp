<!-- 
Develop a web page that will re-direct users to respective pages based on their age. The
following tasks should be followed:
a) Accept the user’s age in a text field through a form.
b) By using the function checkAge(), check the user’s age and open its respective
page according to the criteria below:
        Age     Page
        7 - 12 upsr.html
        13 - 15 pmr.html
        16 - 17 spm.html
c) Display an alert message “Your age is not suitable for this website”
if the user’s age is out of range.
